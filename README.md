# Contactless-Control-of-mouse-using-hand-gestures
The main objective of virtual mouse system is to control mouse cursor  function by using hand instead of physical mouse. The aim is to create a cost-free hand gesture recognition for laptops and PCs with webcam. In a computer system, colors are represented in different formats like HSV (Hue Saturation Value) and BGR (Blue, Green,  Red). Withthe BGR format, a pixel is represented by blue, green, and red parameters with blue being most significant and red being less significant. By using the Object tracking system, the  mouse andits basic operations like mouse pointing, selection, and deselection using left  click can be controlled. Convex Hull and Convexity defects are other methods to detect hand and perform hand gestures
